The E-R model can be used with your query and data access patterns to define the physical model so that
the data that is read together is stored together.


to calculate total stock per product i would create an empty object. then check every entity in the database,
 if it’s ‘product’ value exists as a key in my new object, increment its value by one, if it doesn’t,
  add it to the object as a 'key' with a value of 0.
after traversing every item in the database it will return the completed table. an example of this can be found in
MongoDB
db.collection.find().forEach(<function>)



the same method can be implemented for the products in a warehouse. If we check every entity, in this case
 each product, we simply create the map on warehouse value. if it’s ‘warehouse’ value exists as a key in my
 object, increment its value by one, if it doesn’t, add it to the object.

a simple arithmetic formula could help determine incremental differences. we would have to determine
 the difference between total stock in month n and the stock in n-1.

for period N we would need the quantity of all those products with an undefined Date Out. This constitutes
everything currently in stock.

for period N-1 we would need everything currently in stock plus all those with a date out after the start of period N-1
and before the beginning at the beginning of period N.

The difference between these two is the month on month change in stock.
