for full working example of the Jquery exchange, open exchange.html in your browser.
the recommended exchange API has a paywall, its not possible to change the source
currency without upgrading to at least the minimum plan. My function works, and the
network response is that i need to upgrade in order to get my desired base. it runs Search
and returns only American USD rates.

A fully working demonstration would require uncommenting and adding line 27 the url on line 30
