I have used the online resource draw.io to design the database. It is shared through
my google drive account.

  It is useful to start off with entity relationship modeling in order to define the entities, relationships,
   and attributes in your application:
  * Entities: Main objects in your application, in this case we’ll say products and warehouses
  * Attributes: properties of the objects, id, warehouse, date stored.
  * Relationships: connections between entities, product has 1-1 relationship with its warehouse but each warehouse can have many products

  The (minimum) Entities in this case are:
  * Product, Warehouse. The relations are:
  * A warehouse holds many products
  * each product has one warehouse
